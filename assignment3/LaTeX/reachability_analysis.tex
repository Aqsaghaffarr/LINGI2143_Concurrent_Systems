\section{Reachability analysis}
\label{sec:Reachability analysis}
Our model is bounded, because it's impossible to have more tokens than in the inital state. In our graph, there are no way to create more tokens than the inital state.


\begin{table}[h]
   \begin{tabular}{|r|r|}
       \hline
       Number of states & 30 \\
       \hline
       Number of transitions & 60 \\
       \hline
       Number of deadlock states & 6 \\
       \hline
   \end{tabular}
\end{table}
