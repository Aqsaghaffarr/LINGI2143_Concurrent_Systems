\section{Reachability analysis}
\label{sec:Reachability analysis}
Our model is bounded, because as we can see in P-invariant and T-invariant there
 are no creation of new tokens. Compared to the inital state, they are no
 multiplication of the number of clerks, officers, vehicles, inspectors and
 coroners.

       Number of states & 30 \\

       Number of transitions & 60 \\

       Number of deadlock states & 6 \\
